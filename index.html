            <p class="p1" style="color: white; margin-left: 200px;margin-right: 200px;font-size: 18px">Miriam Palma Defensor was a Filipina academic, lawyer, judge, author, and stateswoman,
                who served in all three branches of the Philippine government: judicial, executive, and 
                legislative. Defensor Santiago was named one of The 100 Most Powerful Women in the World in 
                1997 by The Australian.She was known for being a long-serving Senator of the Republic of
                the Philippines, an elected judge of the International Criminal Court, and the sole woman recipient
                of the Philippines' highest national honor, the Quezon Service Cross.

            <p class="p1" style="color: white; margin-left: 200px;margin-right: 200px;font-size: 20px">Defensor Santiago was known as the Dragon Lady, the Platinum Lady, the Incorruptible Lady, the Impregnable Lady, Feisty Senator, The Doctor of All Laws, the Omniscient Woman and most popularly, the Iron Lady of Asia. She is colloquially known in Philippine pop culture as simply Miriam or MDS, and is positively cited for her lifelong dedication to public service in the Philippine government.</p>

            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px"> Defensor Santiago served as Legal Officer of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees at Geneva,
            Switzerland. She was assigned to the Conferences and Treaties Section. She became skilled at 
            treaty negotiation and drafting. She resigned her position when her father in the Philippines 
            developed prostate cancer.</p>
            <li class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Judge During Martial Law</li>
            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 30px"> Defensor Santiago was appointed judge of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City,
            Metro Manila by President Ferdinand Marcos. She was the youngest judge appointed to Metro 
            Manila, and exempted from the practice of first serving as a judge outside Metro Manila.
            As a RTC judge, she quickly proclaimed a "no postponement" policy. 
            At that time, cases were tried in segments that were usually a month apart, 
            resulting in trials that took years to finish. Lawyers were prone to seek postponement 
            of trial. As a result, trial judges scheduled ten or fifteen cases a day, so that they 
            could make up for cases postponed. Defensor Santiago scheduled only five cases a day, 
            heard each case, and disposed of the highest number of cases in her first year in office.
            Defensor Santiago became nationally famous when she issued perhaps the first decision to 
            rule against martial law. At that time, alleged illegal public assemblies were declared as
            crimes and were punishable by death.</p>
            <li class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 25px;font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Immigration Commissioner</li>
            <img src="2.jpg" alt="alt" style="height:270px;width:370px;float: right">
           <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 500px;"> After martial law, in 1988, President Corazon Aquino appointed Defensor Santiago as
            commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation.
            At that time, the BID was one of the most corrupt government agencies in Southeast
            Asia. Defensor Santiago declared the Philippines as 
            "the fake passport capital of the world", and directed raids against criminal 
            syndicates, including the Yakuza. 
            She filled the CID detention center with alien criminals, and ordered construction
            of another detention center. She extended to legal aliens protection from widespread
            extortion by requesting President Aquino to issue an executive order that authorized 
            the "alien legalization program".
            She received serious death threats, but proclaimed: 
            <b>"<u>I eat death threats for breakfast</u>"</b>.
            A member of the House of Representatives, 
            Laguna Rep. Nereo Joaquin, delivered a privilege speech in 1992
            and denounced her raids against pedophile communities in Central Luzon run by 
            alien pedophiles.</p>

            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 30px">Defensor Santiago was first elected senator in 1995. In 1997, her presidential 
            rival Fidel Ramos initiated a "people's campaign" for an infinite presidential term.
            Defensor Santiago harshly criticized Ramos' campaign and went to court. 
            In a landmark case, Defensor Santiago vs COMELEC, she won and preserved 
            the people's mandate for term limits. She again ran for president in the 1998 
            presidential elections, with running-mate Francisco Tatad, 
            but lost amidst heavy propaganda concerning her mental health, 
            which was later proven false.She was one of the few senators who were against the
            opening of the brown envelope during the impeachment trial of then-President Joseph
            Estrada, who was her foe in the 1998 presidential elections. She said afterwards:
            At that time, I wanted to apply the rules of court technically. 
            Since there is no allegation of wrongdoing in connection with the notorious 
            second envelope, I voted that we should not open the second envelope
            until and after the complaint had already been amended 
            I was among those demonized because I voted against the opening of the second 
            envelope – dahil ang paniwala ng taong bayan, kung ayaw namin buksan ang second 
            envelope na 'yan, may tinatago kami.</p>
            <li style="color: white; margin-left: 20px;font-size: 20px">Second Term 2004-2016</li>
            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 30px">Defensor Santiago ran for 
                senator in 2004 and was elected. She focused on creating significant laws
                that changed the country as a whole. She ran again for senator in 2010 and won.
                During her three terms, she served as chair mostly of the foreign relations 
                committee and the constitutional amendments committee. She was elected as 
                official candidate of her party People's Reform Party, serving also as chair 
                of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Commission on Appointments. 
                She exposed and named numerous jueteng (illegal gambling) lords and 
                illegal-logging lords throughout her terms.</p>
            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 30px">In 2011, Defensor Santiago
                was elected as a judge of the International Criminal Court (ICC) which hears
                cases against humanity for former heads of state. She was the first Asian from 
                a third-world country to be elected to such a post. She resigned in 2014 after
                being diagnosed with lung cancer. She was one of the senators who backed 
                Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial;
                he was ultimately impeached due to corruption.</p>
            <p class="p1" style="color: white;font-size: 18px;margin-right: 30px">In December 2012, she exposed
                that the Senate president, Juan Ponce Enrile, used Senate funds to give away 
                as cash gifts. Every senator, except Defensor Santiago and two others,
                received ₱2 million as a chunk of the Filipino population lived in poverty.
                This led to the Priority Development Assistance Fund scandal, 
                which put the Senate president behind bars with charges of plunder. 
                Defensor Santiago's live Senate hearings in the case led to public 
                outrage and support for Defensor Santiago's call to abolish the pork 
                barrel system.</p>
